# Effective-Data-Visulization
 Time and money are invested in data collection, collection speed, storage capacity, and processing. All of these share the same flaw: they don’t assess the data’s utility. The focus should be on determining the true worth of the data your company has accumulated and then learning how to extract that value from the terabytes of data it has amassed. Decisionmaking is greatly aided by data visualization. 
The graphic display of information and data is known as data visualization. Data visualization tools offer an easy approach to observe and analyze trends, outliers, and patterns in data by utilizing visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps. Additionally, it offers a great tool for staff members or business owners to clearly deliver data to non-technical audiences. 
For visualizations to effectively reach an audience in a given environment, there are a few key steps to take. Some parameters for good visualization are listed below. 

**Data visualizations should have a clear purpose and audience:** 
You won't wander through your data aimlessly if you have a defined goal. A purpose that is clear will make it easier to identify the crucial features and data sets required to produce visualizations that best address your main concerns. 
Keep your audience in mind when researching the data and developing your final data visualizations. What information do they need? What matters to them? What other queries do they have that you could address with your visualization or a different perspective?

The right-hand layout, which groups sales by region into a single chart and represents all amounts graphically rather than quantitatively, makes it simpler to compare sales by category or by location.  

**Choose the right type of visualization or chart for your data:** 
Your data story will either benefit or suffer as a result of the sort of chart you use. There may be a variety of charts that are useful, therefore it's important to be extremely clear about your data visualization's objective and target audience because 
they can both influence which chart is most appropriate.

By emphasizing comparability over precise amounts, a bar chart enables the reader to compare each category more quickly labelling and correctly. 

**Label for clarity, not as a rule: **
Too many or too few labels can cause problems when your data visualization. Take a step back from the visualization and consider whether it is visually straightforward to understand based on how the labels are arranged. There may be too many labels. Consider the information you have presented most forcefully as if you are viewing it for the first time. When you read the label, which one stands out to you the most?

The map is made less cluttered by removing the labels for each state, which also directs the reader's attention to the states with the highest and lowest sales. Since state forms are easily recognizable, labelling each one isn't a top concern because it can take attention away from the data.  

Use color to highlight important information or to differentiate or compare: 
Data visualizations that use color can be more attractive and fascinating. But there have been instances of data visualizations when color is overdone, misinterpreted, or serves to further confuse rather than to further clarify. Always make sure that color makes the objective of your data visualization clear and draws attention 
to it. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129209796/228330691-545854c8-89a0-4940-9a69-0e948170e937.png)
In contrast to the ineffective example, which merely uses color as decoration, the example on the right provides the color more meaning and purpose.  
Avoid misleading visualizations: 
Information overload can be confusing. People won't know what to focus on if you provide too much information at once, and they might pick the incorrect information. You must lead viewers through your data visualization and convey the information appropriately and concisely. They most certainly haven't done as much investigation into the data as you have, so you need to use your data visualization to influence them to draw precise, defensible conclusions.

Because the axis does not begin at 0, and the graph is stretched vertically to make the decline appear more dramatic, the first visualization creates the mistaken impression that shipping times have decreased significantly. Once adjusted, you can observe that the typical shipping times have barely changed over the previous four years.  

**Keep your visualizations simple less is more: **

You need to choose carefully what you portray at a time when there is so much information available. Remove any elements from your visualization that don't support the data's main point. Feel free to eliminate something if it doesn't provide context or pertain to the visualization's goal. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129209796/228330870-3baeec78-2b78-4c8f-9694-2771a72fba78.png)
The bar graph does not clearly communicate that the purpose is to compare sales over time for two different categories because the reader is inclined to switch back and forth between both axes and the data to read it. And it’s clearly communicated by the line graph on the right. 

**Story Telling: **

To grasp the data and to connect with the visualization's audience, visualization designers must go deeply into the data. Good designers are able to tell an engaging tale through the visualization in addition to selecting the appropriate graph and data range. 
Particularly in the digital age, the term "storytelling" has come to refer to a more humane method of information delivery. Data storytelling uses the same fundamental ideas to enhance the dissemination of the results of data analysis. Transforming complex analysis outputs into persuasive, understandable narratives that influence corporate decisions, data storytelling is regarded as a new trending field and a desirable "data-driven" skill. The attention of C-level executives is being drawn by this fusion of art, science, and presentation skills. Data visualization positions are now in high demand, bridging the gap between operational and decision-making teams. 
As we apply some helpful visualization parameters, let's look at some examples of both good and bad visualizations. 

**Good Visualization Example: Global Warming **

One of the biggest problems facing the planet is global warming. Understanding how and why something is happening will help us prevent the environment from getting even hotter. 
The term "global climate change" describes the increase in earth's temperature that is due to human activity. It is caused by the greenhouse effect of several gases in our atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which stop the heat from escaping. Since the middle of the 20th century, human activity has caused a major increase in the concentration of these gases; the main contributors to this increase are the burning of fossil fuels (oil and gas) and deforestation. Drought occurrences are increasing and lasting longer, wildfires are occurring more frequently, and there are more extreme weather events. 
We must review long-term records in order to clearly discern signs of climate change. Direct evidence of a long-term warming trend in global air temperatures is provided by measurements of the temperatures of the oceans and the atmosphere taken over many years. 
The average worldwide temperature records from 1850 to 2021 (Source of data: 
Meteorological Organization) show this pattern very clearly. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129209796/228330978-e1d64637-70c8-4c15-9740-ac73a30a572c.png)
worldwide average temperature data from 1850 to 2021. Vertical bars indicate fluctuation around the annual averages, which are shown by red dots. The pre-Industrial average temperature is shown by the solid red line, and the temperature anomaly represents the difference between that average and the pre-Industrial baseline. 
Date ranges, explanation legends, and technical terminology make this traditional data visualization difficult for the general public to understand. The long-term trends and variations in temperature are incredibly evident in the depiction below since it does not include any of the distracting elements found in conventional climate representations. Without our having to think about it, our visual system will comprehend the stripes. It has been regarded as one of the best depictions of global warming since it is simple to grasp and requires little data interpretation.

Worldwide average temperature data from 1850 to 2021 
This report makes it all too clear that rapid and significant climate action is required in order to avoid catastrophic climate impacts during this century. We can still hold global temperature increase to 1.5 – 2ᵒC if we reduce GHG emissions rapidly and dramatically. 

**Bad Visualization Example: Water on Earth **

The water cycle, one of Earth's most potent systems, continuously circulates water, which is essential to life as we know it. Between the ocean, atmosphere, and land, water flows indefinitely. The amount of water in, on, and above our world is fixed, or finite, and neither grows nor shrinks over time. 
Water is vital for life. For drinking and sanitation, for our food, cattle, and industry, as well as for the development and maintenance of the ecosystems that support all life, clean freshwater is a must. Less than 1% of the world's water is readily available freshwater, which can be found in rivers, lakes, wetlands, and aquifers. 
It might seem like there is plenty of water to go around and that we will never run out of this precious resource because water makes up three-quarters of the earth's surface. However, the amount of usable fresh water is constrained. The oceans contain salt water, which makes up more than 97 percent of the water on Earth. Glaciers, ice caps, and snowcovered mountain ranges retain 2% of the world's fresh water. Only 1% of the water on Earth is still accessible to us for our daily water needs. Our fresh water resources are kept in lakes, rivers, and streams on the surface of the planet as well as in aquifers beneath the surface of the ground and bedrock fissures (surface water). 
The need for water increases along with the growth of the human population worldwide. Freshwater ecosystems are under stress due to the disruption of natural water cycles brought on by human activities and climate change. The detrimental effects on our freshwater systems are further exacerbated by poor water management, pollution, the construction of infrastructure, and resource extraction. With this important resource, we cannot afford to be irresponsible. 
We must educate the public about the scarcity of fresh water and its significance. The illustration below shows the various forms of water that exist on earth. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129209796/228331152-887d3177-14d4-423d-8447-ef081b1abc4d.png)
Water on Earth 
This illustration was made to demonstrate the amount of fresh water that is available in relation to the overall amount of water that is present on Earth. But this picture doesn't show how much water there is overall or what kinds there are. Poor graphics were employed to illustrate it. It is challenging to understand the various forms of water and the significance of fresh water with this visualization. The purpose of the map is not made clear in the visualization, making it one of the bad visualizations. The graphic below clearly illustrates the various forms of water that are present on Earth as well as how little fresh water there is.
